# Integration between Axis devices and Google Cloud Platform

## Introduction

[AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP)](https://www.axis.com/support/developer-support/axis-camera-application-platform) is an open application platform that enables members of [Axis Application Development Partner (ADP)](https://www.axis.com/partners/adp-partner-program) Program to develop applications that can be downloaded and installed on Axis network cameras and video encoders.

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP) provides highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure to individuals, companies, and governments.

This repository focuses on providing examples where we create the integration between the Axis device and GCP. If you are interested in camera applications and the different API surfaces an application can use, please visit our related repository [AxisCommunications/acap3-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap3-examples/).
