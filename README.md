# Integration between Axis devices and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Introduction

The [Axis Developer Documentation](https://developer.axis.com/) serves as a comprehensive resource hub for developers and solution builders aiming to build applications tailored for Axis network-connected devices.

[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com) provides highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure to individuals, companies, and governments.

This repository focuses on providing examples where we create the integration between the Axis device and GCP.

## Code examples
